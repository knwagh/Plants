          Ginger is a rhizome that is easy to grow even in pots. Wash the rhizome thoroughly to remove the mud, grate or cut into small pieces and steep in hot water for a few minutes to make a soothing tea. Ginger tea is one of the most effective remedies against indigestion and flatulence. Some people also squeeze a little ginger juice into a tea made from tulsi and honey and use to combat cough and cold. People with motion sickness often find that chewing or sucking on a small piece of ginger helps reduce the nausea or vomiting they encounter when travelling.

          Also known as coriander leaves, cilantro is easy to grow from coriander seeds that are used as a spice. Like the seeds, the leaves of this herb also possess several health benefits including  digestive and carminative properties and thus, help avoid flatulence and indigestion. Cilantro may be finely chopped and sprinkled on curries, soups and salads or incorporated into green chutney to accompany sandwiches and other breakfast dishes such as idli or dosa. Chewing on a few cilantro leaves can also help mask bad breath.</span></a>

        Malabar spinach is a creeper that grows easily in a pot provided you give it enough support. The succulent leaves and stems of this creeper are rich in folic acid and iron and this makes it a good herb for those who are anaemic and pregnant women. The leaves are generally roasted in a little ghee and then ground into a chutney using other ingredients such as coconut and green chillies. The roasted leaves may also be included in gravy dishes such as dal or sambar.</span></a>

They are also available dried, though the aroma is largely inferior.</p>

            <p>In the Indian traditional system of medicine, Ayurveda, hibiscus, especially white hibiscus and red hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), is considered to have medicinal properties.

The leaves and flowers are ground into a fine paste with a little water, and the resulting lathery paste is used as a shampoo plus conditioner.</p>
