          According to the American Cancer Society, although centella is promoted for its health benefits, "available scientific evidence does not support claims of its effectiveness for treating cancer or any other disease in humans".Side effects are rare but may include skin allergy and burning sensations (with external use), headache, stomach upset, nausea, and dizziness.

         The paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. In India, a plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible. To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugarorlemon mix over the dried paste, or simply adding some form of sugar to the paste. After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away.</span></a> </div>
